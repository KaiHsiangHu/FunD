\format{A list includes two objects:
\describe{
  \item{data}{is a data frame with 23 fungi incidence frequencies data and two types of forest: logged and unlogged. The first row is the number of sampling units for each type of forest.}
  \item{dij}{is a trait-based functional distance between the i-th and j-th species among the 23 fungi.}
